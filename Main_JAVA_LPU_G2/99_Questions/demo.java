// Return a version of the given array where all the 10's have been removed. The remaining elements should shift left towards the start of the array as needed, and the empty spaces a the end of the array should be 0. So {1, 10, 10, 2} yields {1, 2, 0, 0}. You may modify and return the given array or make a new array.


// withoutTen([1, 10, 10, 2]) → [1, 2, 0, 0]
// withoutTen([10, 2, 10]) → [2, 0, 0]
// withoutTen([1, 99, 10]) → [1, 99, 0]
